# Ontology-Graphing
A tool that parses through .csv files generated off of Ontology files from the SCD Finder and graphs their P_Values.
This tool is still a WIP as I'm currently working on making an infrastructure that'll allow this file to connect with a hosted web server where the files needed will be saved.
